## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected vulnerabilities via a private channel to avoid exposing end users:

- **Email**: mattpopovich@outlook.com (include “Unsane security” in the subject)
- **GitHub Security Advisory**: https://github.com/mpopv/unsane/security/advisories/new

I will acknowledge receipt within **3 business days** and aim to provide an initial remediation plan within **10 business days**. When a fix ships, a coordinated disclosure window (typically 7–14 days) will be agreed upon before public announcement. Please include:

- A minimal reproduction payload
- Impacted Unsane version(s) and runtime environment
- Expected vs. actual sanitizer output

If you need encrypted communication, request a PGP key in your initial report.
